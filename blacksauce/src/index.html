        Blacksauce Kitchen is a mobile food business in Baltimore. Handmade biscuits are our signature product, though we make so much more. We sell our goods at our shop on 29th Street and farmer’s markets, in addition to doing private catering in and around the city.</p>

        <p class="textColor__white">Our mission is : to produce genuine food.  We strive to make food that connects with our audience; food that makes someone pause; food that prompts two girls to skip towards the tent; food that makes a man dance ever so subtly because it reminds him of another time or place; food that helps people remember.</p>
